# XLog

This project uses [XLog](https://xlog.emadelsaid.com/) to build the pages from *.md files.

Until now (12-April-2025) I've never heard about XLog. The home page says

> Xlog is one of the most complete static site generator for digital gardens and knowledge 
> bases. Written in Go makes it the fastest in its class. Xlog focuses on enriching markdown 
> files and surfacing implicit links between pages.

I read a paywalled article in the German [c't magazine](https://shop.heise.de/magazine/ct-magazin/) about [digital gardens](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Nerd-Trend-Digitaler-Garten-Die-eigene-Website-als-persoenliches-Wissensarchiv-10344169.html) and went 
from there to [this tutorial](https://xlog.emadelsaid.com/tutorials/Create%20your%20own%20digital%20garden%20on%20Github/).


## Installing

If you have [Go](https://go.dev/) on your machine, you can simply run `go install github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog/cmd/xlog@latest` to install XLog. XLog can then be called with `~/go/bin/xlog`.
