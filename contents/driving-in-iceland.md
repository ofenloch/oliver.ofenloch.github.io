# Driving in Iceland - 

## [Dos and Don'ts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqbSACg1XQ)

Do not stop on the side of the road. Never ever! The roads have no shoulder making stopping on the side of the road dangerous for all.

Do not drive off-road.

Head lights and seat belts ALWAYS on. (It's the law.)

Whatch for sheep (and other animals).

Do not speed. It's very expensive - and dangerous. There are speed cameras all over the place. Fines are up to 1000 US$.

Fuel up on EVERY chance. Never go below half a tank full of fuel.

Pay attention to road signs.

Always check [road.is](road.is) for road conditions and other information.


## [Gas Stations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZL6Mbkn68Q)

Never use the "fill up my tank" option at a gas pump.This blocks about 300 US$ on your card. Best thing is to choose 3000 to 4000 

## [2WD or 4WD?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSOt07afafU)Â´

All F roads require 4WD.
