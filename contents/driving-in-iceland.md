Do not stop on the side of the road. Never ever! The roads have no shoulder making stopping on the side of the road dangerous for all.

Do not drive off-road.

Head lights and seat belts ALWAYS on. (It's the law.)

Whatch for sheep (and other animals).

Do not speed. It's very expensive - and dangerous. There are speed cameras all over the place. Fines are up to 1000 US$.

Fuel up on EVERY chance.

Pay attention to road signs.

Always check [road.is](road.is) for road conditions and other information.
